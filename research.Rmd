* <strong style="color:black;font-size:22px;"> Navigating Conservation Seas: Estimating Marine Protected Areas Effectiveness and Unveiling the Intricacies of Industrial Fishing Behavior </strong>  [[PDF]](https://jorgephd.github.io/jorge-montero.github.io/research/MPAs_Fishing_MRE_vf.pdf) [[Slides here]](https://github.com/JorgePhD/jorge-montero.github.io/blob/main/research/Final_Slides_JM.pdf) with [Jorge Maldonado](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/maldonado)

 <p align="justify"> **Abstrac:** Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are the primary tool for marine conservation, promoting the sustainable
use of marine resources. We examine the dynamics and behavior of industrial fishing vessels around MPAs,
using comprehensive global fishing data to analyze whether these vessels are deterred by MPAs. Through
spatial regression discontinuity models, we quantify the effect of the existence of MPAs on the number of
hours of fishing activity conducted by industrial vessels. We find that MPAs have been effective in reducing
fishing efforts within their areas; however, this effect is not homogeneous across all protected areas. We
also find evidence of strategic behavior by vessels, which consider the probabilities of being caught and
penalized, along with the benefits of engaging in fishing activities within MPAs, taking into account the
implicit monitoring and control capacities of each protected area. This article provides relevant evidence
to strengthen marine conservation and the management of marine protected areas by gaining a clearer
understanding of the behavior of industrial fishing vessels. </p>

* <strong style="color:black;font-size:22px;"> Unmasking the Threat to Property Rights: Unauthorized Fishing Activity during the COVID-19 Pandemic </strong> [[PDF]](https://github.com/JorgePhD/jorge-montero.github.io/blob/main/research/Lockdown_and_Fishing.pdf) [[Slides here]](https://github.com/JorgePhD/jorge-montero.github.io/blob/main/research/Slides_Lockdown_and_Fishing170424.pdf)

 <p align="justify"> **Abstrac:** The global health crisis has disrupted economic activities and posed significant challenges
to fisheries management and enforcement. In this paper, I examine the impact of the COVID-
19 pandemic on property rights in the context of unauthorized fishing activity. This study
investigates to what extent the pandemic has led to an increase in unauthorized fishing, potentially
undermining existing property rights systems. To do so, I compile a comprehensive
database with weekly, country-level fishing effort data for 146 countries before and after the
COVID-19 lockdowns and international fishing access agreements data. I employ Differences
in Differences approaches to shed light on the consequences of the pandemic for marine resource
governance. The findings indicate that the implementation of restrictions resulted in
a decrease in overall fishing efforts; however, unauthorized fishing activity saw an increase.
Heterogeneous effects are found when I consider income-country variable, and Ocean Health
Index components. Results suggests that industrial vessel are responsive to economics incentives.
This paper offers valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders aiming to protect
and strengthen property rights in the face of unforeseen disruptions. </p>

* <strong style="color:black;font-size:22px;">Towards Resilient Land Use Systems. A Multi-Scale Network Analysis for the Water-Energy-Land-Food Nexus.</strong> with [Jorge Marco](https://www.efdinitiative.org/about-efd/people/renau-jorge-marco), [Miguel Ramirez](https://co.linkedin.com/in/mianr13), [William Martinez], [Ivan Lizarazo](http://www.cienciasagrarias.bogota.unal.edu.co/iv%C3%A1n-alberto-lizarazo-salcedo), [Jorge Forero], [Ali Kharrazi](https://iiasa.ac.at/staff/ali-kharrazi) , [Nadia Combariza](https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/fbz/zentren/zeu/Team/zeumembersall/NCombariza/NCombariza), and [Alicia Correa](https://alycorreab585.wixsite.com/misitio).

<p align="justify"> **Abstrac:** We develop an analytical framework to assess the impact of land use changes on the
composition and resilience of the Water-Energy-Land-Food (WELF) nexus. Because
WELF comprises integral components of land use systems, effective WELF
management requires multi-scale assessments due to the diverse interests and drivers
of change. We apply this framework to the region of Maria La Baja, a Colombian
Caribbean sub-watershed. Our results reveal variation in the WELF nexus composition
across different spatial scales, from local to regional, with Food consistently playing a
crucial role in enhancing resilience. The significance of Energy and Water varies by the
spatial scale. Other factors, such as the abandonment of agricultural land and
increased deforestation, play an important role in determining resilience at sub-regional
scales. We find that a 30% reduction in land transfers among nexus elements
consistently decreases resilience, while a 30% increase yields mixed effects,
especially when it involves Food or Water transfers. We find that enhancing resilience
depends on interconnected factors. These include changes in the two dimensions of
resilience (efficiency and redundancy), the structure of the interactions of the elements
of the nexus, and the intensity of land transfers from one element to another.
Enhancing resilience will assist decision-makers in adapting to uncertainties and
recovering from disruptions. </p>
