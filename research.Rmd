* <strong style="color:black;font-size:22px;"> [JMP] Unmasking the Threat to Property Rights: Unauthorized Fishing Activity during the COVID-19 Pandemic </strong> [[PDF]](https://github.com/JorgePhD/jorge-montero.github.io/blob/main/research/Lockdown_and_Fishing.pdf) [[Slides here]](https://github.com/JorgePhD/jorge-montero.github.io/blob/main/research/Slides_Lockdown_and_Fishing170424.pdf) with [Jorge Bonilla](https://jobonill.wixsite.com/jorgebonilla)

 <p align="justify"> **Abstrac:** The global health crisis has disrupted economic activities and posed significant challenges
       to fisheries management, control, and surveillance. In this paper, we examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic 
       on property rights in the context of unauthorized fishing activity providing theoretical and empirical evidences. 
       This study investigates to what extent the pandemic has led to an increase in unauthorized fishing, potentially 
       undermining existing property rights systems. To do so, we compile a comprehensive database with weekly, country-level 
       fishing effort data for 146 countries before and during the COVID-19 lockdowns and international fishing access agreements 
       data. We employ  Differences in Differences approaches to shed light on the consequences of the pandemic for marine resource 
       governance. The findings indicate that the stringency of the restrictions led to a decrease in authorized fishing efforts. 
       However, unauthorized fishing hours increased, but we did not find any effects on the number of vessels engaged in unauthorized 
       fishing due to the onset of the lockdowns. The increase in unauthorized fishing hours was higher in low- and middle-income countries, 
       and in areas with a higher biodiversity index. These results inform the design of control policies by understanding the motivations of 
       fishermen in low-monitoring scenarios. </p>

* <strong style="color:black;font-size:22px;"> Navigating Conservation Seas: Estimating Marine Protected Areas Effectiveness and Unveiling the Intricacies of Industrial Fishing Behavior </strong>  [[PDF]](https://jorgephd.github.io/jorge-montero.github.io/research/MPAs_Fishing_MRE_vf.pdf) [[Slides here]](https://github.com/JorgePhD/jorge-montero.github.io/blob/main/research/Final_Slides_JM.pdf) with [Jorge Maldonado](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/maldonado)

 <p align="justify"> **Abstrac:** Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are the primary tool for marine conservation, promoting the sustainable
use of marine resources. We examine the dynamics and behavior of industrial fishing vessels around MPAs,
using comprehensive global fishing data to analyze whether these vessels are deterred by MPAs. Through
spatial regression discontinuity models, we quantify the effect of the existence of MPAs on the number of
hours of fishing activity conducted by industrial vessels. We find that MPAs have been effective in reducing
fishing efforts within their areas; however, this effect is not homogeneous across all protected areas. We
also find evidence of strategic behavior by vessels, which consider the probabilities of being caught and
penalized, along with the benefits of engaging in fishing activities within MPAs, taking into account the
implicit monitoring and control capacities of each protected area. This article provides relevant evidence
to strengthen marine conservation and the management of marine protected areas by gaining a clearer
understanding of the behavior of industrial fishing vessels. </p>

* <strong style="color:black;font-size:22px;"> Examining the Effects of Fuel Subsidy on Unauthorized Fishing Activity: the Case of the Program Reforms in China on Large Trawler Fleets </strong> [[PDF]](https://github.com/JorgePhD/jorge-montero.github.io/blob/main/research/Fuel_Subsidies_Fishing.pdf)

 <p align="justify"> **Abstrac:** In recent years, there has been significant discussion regarding the impacts of input subsidies on the sustainability of marine ecosystems, particularly in terms of promoting overexploitation through the marginal reduction of costs; moreover, IUU fishing has significant implications for the sustainability of many fisheries worldwide. Using a newly released dataset, I examine the impact of the fuel subsidies provision on fishing activity and unauthorized fishing following a fuel subsidy program reform introduced in 2016 by Chinese government. The Chinese fishing fleet is the largest in the world, with its coverage extending globally. The Chinese government has been known for providing a wide variety of subsidies within its economy to bolster its economic position relative to other world economies. In 2016, China introduced a reform to its fuel subsidy program for fishing fleets due to high levels of subsidy expenditure, fuel consumption, and overfishing. By leveraging the discontinuities introduced by the reform, I identified that access to input subsidies created distortions in the benefit function of fisheries. This was evidenced by an increase in distant water fishing activity and in unauthorized fishing hours. </p>

* <strong style="color:black;font-size:22px;">Towards Resilient Land Use Systems. A Multi-Scale Network Analysis for the Water-Energy-Land-Food Nexus.</strong> with [Jorge Marco](https://www.efdinitiative.org/about-efd/people/renau-jorge-marco), [Miguel Ramirez](https://co.linkedin.com/in/mianr13), [William Martinez], [Ivan Lizarazo](http://www.cienciasagrarias.bogota.unal.edu.co/iv%C3%A1n-alberto-lizarazo-salcedo), [Jorge Forero], [Ali Kharrazi](https://iiasa.ac.at/staff/ali-kharrazi) , [Nadia Combariza](https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/fbz/zentren/zeu/Team/zeumembersall/NCombariza/NCombariza), and [Alicia Correa](https://alycorreab585.wixsite.com/misitio).

<p align="justify"> **Abstrac:** We develop an analytical framework to assess the impact of land use changes on the
composition and resilience of the Water-Energy-Land-Food (WELF) nexus. Because
WELF comprises integral components of land use systems, effective WELF
management requires multi-scale assessments due to the diverse interests and drivers
of change. We apply this framework to the region of Maria La Baja, a Colombian
Caribbean sub-watershed. Our results reveal variation in the WELF nexus composition
across different spatial scales, from local to regional, with Food consistently playing a
crucial role in enhancing resilience. The significance of Energy and Water varies by the
spatial scale. Other factors, such as the abandonment of agricultural land and
increased deforestation, play an important role in determining resilience at sub-regional
scales. We find that a 30% reduction in land transfers among nexus elements
consistently decreases resilience, while a 30% increase yields mixed effects,
especially when it involves Food or Water transfers. We find that enhancing resilience
depends on interconnected factors. These include changes in the two dimensions of
resilience (efficiency and redundancy), the structure of the interactions of the elements
of the nexus, and the intensity of land transfers from one element to another.
Enhancing resilience will assist decision-makers in adapting to uncertainties and
recovering from disruptions. </p>
