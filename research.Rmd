* <strong style="color:black;font-size:22px;"> [JMP] Unmasking the Threat to Property Rights: Unauthorized Fishing Activity during the COVID-19 Pandemic </strong> [[PDF]](https://jorgephd.github.io/jorge-montero.github.io/research/Lockdown_and_Fishing.pdf) [[Slides here]](https://jorgephd.github.io/jorge-montero.github.io/research/Slides_Lockdown_and_Fishing170424.pdf) with [Jorge Bonilla](https://jobonill.wixsite.com/jorgebonilla)

 <p align="justify"> **Abstrac:** The global health crisis has disrupted economic activities and posed significant challenges to fisheries management, control, and surveillance. In this paper, we examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on property rights in the context of unauthorized fishing activity providing theoretical and empirical evidences. This study investigates to what extent the pandemic has led to an increase in unauthorized fishing, potentially undermining existing property rights systems. To do so, we compile a comprehensive database with weekly, country-level fishing effort data for 146 countries before and during the COVID-19 lockdowns and international fishing access agreements data. We employ  Differences in Differences approaches to shed light on the consequences of the pandemic for marine resource governance. The findings indicate that the stringency of the restrictions led to a decrease in authorized fishing efforts. However, unauthorized fishing hours increased, but we did not find any effects on the number of vessels engaged in unauthorized fishing due to the onset of the lockdowns. The increase in unauthorized fishing hours was higher in low- and middle-income countries, and in areas with a higher biodiversity index. These results inform the design of control policies by understanding the motivations of fishermen in low-monitoring scenarios.

* <strong style="color:black;font-size:22px;"> Illuminating the Shadows: Assessing Compliance and Effectiveness in Marine Protected Areas with Satellite Imagery and AIS Data </strong>  [[PDF]](https://jorgephd.github.io/jorge-montero.github.io/research/MPAs_Fishing_MRE_vf.pdf) [[Slides here]](https://jorgephd.github.io/jorge-montero.github.io/research/Final_Slides_JM.pdf) with [Jorge Maldonado](https://economia.uniandes.edu.co/maldonado)

 <p align="justify"> **Abstrac:** Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are an essential instrument for marine conservation, aimed at promoting the sustainable use of marine resources. In this study, I examine the dynamics and behavior of industrial fishing vessels in relation to MPAs, leveraging extensive global fishing data. I assess vessel compliance by evaluating their presence within MPAs, using both Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and satellite imagery. The main findings indicate that MPAs significantly reduce industrial fishing activity within their boundaries, with a more pronounced reduction observed in MPAs with higher levels of fishing protection. These findings hold true when using both satellite imagery and AIS data. Differences arise when focusing on Indonesia. In terms of biological conditions for fishing, those MPAs with more favorable fishing conditions tend to experience lower activity compared to other regions, highlighting their effectiveness in preserving these ecosystems. Additionally, evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic led to significant increases in detected activity within MPAs. This research provides valuable insights for strengthening marine conservation efforts and enhancing MPA management by offering a deeper understanding of industrial fishing vessel behavior.

* <strong style="color:black;font-size:22px;"> Fueling the Tensions: Examining the Effects of Fuel Subsidy on Chinese Fleets Compliance </strong> [[PDF]](https://jorgephd.github.io/jorge-montero.github.io/research/Fuel_Subsidies_Fishing.pdf)

 <p align="justify"> **Abstrac:** In recent years, there has been significant discussion regarding the impacts of input subsidies on the sustainability of marine ecosystems, particularly in terms of promoting overexploitation through the marginal reduction of costs; moreover, Illegal, Unauthorized, and Unreported (IUU) fishing has significant implications for the sustainability of many fisheries worldwide. Using a newly released dataset, I examine the impact of the fuel subsidies provision on fishing activity and unauthorized fishing following a fuel subsidy program reform introduced in 2016 by the Chinese government. The Chinese government has been known for providing a wide variety of subsidies within its economy to bolster its economic position relative to other world economies. In 2016, China introduced a reform to its fuel subsidy program for fishing fleets due to high levels of subsidy expenditure, fuel consumption, and overfishing. By leveraging the discontinuities introduced by the reform, I find that after the reform, the hours of unauthorized fishing increased, particularly in Taiwan and in disputed areas. Vessels that receive a greater amount of subsidies reduce their activity within national waters and increase their operations in foreign waters, potentially leading to overexploitation of fish stocks in international waters and conflicts with neighboring countries over disputed fishing grounds. The results suggest that subsidies decrease the level of compliance among fishermen and encourage IUU fishing. </p>

* <strong style="color:black;font-size:22px;">Assessing Resilience in the Water-Energy-Land-Food Nexus: A Multi-Scale Approach in the Colombian Caribbean.</strong> with [Jorge Marco](https://www.efdinitiative.org/about-efd/people/renau-jorge-marco), [Miguel Ramirez](https://co.linkedin.com/in/mianr13), [William Martinez], [Ivan Lizarazo](http://www.cienciasagrarias.bogota.unal.edu.co/iv%C3%A1n-alberto-lizarazo-salcedo), [Jorge Forero], [Ali Kharrazi](https://iiasa.ac.at/staff/ali-kharrazi) , [Nadia Combariza](https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/fbz/zentren/zeu/Team/zeumembersall/NCombariza/NCombariza), and [Alicia Correa](https://alycorreab585.wixsite.com/misitio).

<p align="justify"> **Abstrac:** We develop an analytical framework to assess the impact of land use changes on the
composition and resilience of the Water-Energy-Land-Food (WELF) nexus. Because
WELF comprises integral components of land use systems, effective WELF
management requires multi-scale assessments due to the diverse interests and drivers
of change. We apply this framework to the region of Maria La Baja, a Colombian
Caribbean sub-watershed. Our results reveal variation in the WELF nexus composition
across different spatial scales, from local to regional, with Food consistently playing a
crucial role in enhancing resilience. The significance of Energy and Water varies by the
spatial scale. Other factors, such as the abandonment of agricultural land and
increased deforestation, play an important role in determining resilience at sub-regional
scales. We find that a 30% reduction in land transfers among nexus elements
consistently decreases resilience, while a 30% increase yields mixed effects,
especially when it involves Food or Water transfers. We find that enhancing resilience
depends on interconnected factors. These include changes in the two dimensions of
resilience (efficiency and redundancy), the structure of the interactions of the elements
of the nexus, and the intensity of land transfers from one element to another.
Enhancing resilience will assist decision-makers in adapting to uncertainties and
recovering from disruptions. </p>
